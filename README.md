## ✨ Features - Professional Editor, Zero Cost

Mermalaid includes the features teams usually pay for, while staying free to use:

### Editor Features

- **Monaco Editor** - Write Mermaid with robust syntax highlighting
- **Live Preview** - See updates in real time with smooth debounced rendering (500ms)
- **Resizable Panels** - Drag the divider to set the editor width; your layout is saved across sessions
- **Visual Editor** - Drag and connect flowchart nodes, then sync changes back to code
- **Real-time Syntax Validation** - Catch errors early and fix faster
- **Auto-save** - Keep work in local storage so progress is not lost
- **Dark/Light Mode** - Work comfortably in your preferred theme
- **beautiful-mermaid Themes** - Style both diagrams and app UI with curated themes
- **Toast Notifications** - Get clear feedback for save, export, and error actions
- **AI Assistant** - Chat about the diagram you are looking at with your own API key — **Anthropic** (sent straight from the page to Anthropic) or **IBM Consulting Advantage** (routed through this site's own `/api/ica` function, because the ICA API refuses browser calls; pick the namespace and model in Settings). Keys are stored in your browser only. The assistant sees the current diagram and any render error, answers questions about it, and proposes changes as a card you review and apply — nothing is written to your document until you press Apply
- **AI Syntax Fix** - Fix broken Mermaid syntax quickly using your own OpenAI API key (stored locally on your machine)

### File Management

- **Multiple Diagram Tabs** - Keep several `.mmd` documents open at once and switch between them; unsaved tabs are marked, and the whole set of tabs is restored on your next visit
- **Each Tab Is a Workspace** - A new tab opens empty and asks what it should hold: start a new diagram, open an existing `.mmd` file, or pick one from your recent files (desktop). Opening a file fills the empty tab you are looking at instead of adding another one
- **Unsaved-Change Guards** - Closing a tab with unsaved edits asks first, and on the desktop app closing the window offers to save every unsaved diagram before it goes
- **Open Files** - Import `.mmd`, `.txt`, or `.md` files (pick or drop several at once — each opens in its own tab)
- **Live Reload (desktop)** - Edit the open file in any external editor; Mermalaid re-renders on save
- **Save Diagrams** - Export Mermaid diagrams to local files
- **Export Options**:
  - **SVG Export** - Vector graphics for presentations and documents
  - **PNG Export** - The full diagram at its own size (never cropped to the window, and without the preview's zoom controls), at a resolution you pick: Standard 1× through Ultra 4× for print-quality output. The dialog shows the exact pixel size before you export, and remembers your choice
  - **PDF Export** - One diagram per page, either for the tab you are on or for every open tab combined into a single document. Each page is the size of its own diagram, so nothing is cropped or letterboxed, and the resolution choice doubles as the print resolution (Standard 1× = 96 dpi through Ultra 4× = 384 dpi)
- **ASCII Export** - Unicode box-drawing for terminals (flowcharts, state, sequence, class, ER diagrams)
- **Copy to Clipboard** - Copy Markdown-ready Mermaid blocks for docs and GitHub
- **Private URL Share** - **Copy private link** stores encrypted diagram data in the URL fragment only (no upload, no server-side storage)

- ⚡ **Better performance** using system webview instead of bundled Chromium
- 🔒 **Enhanced security** with Rust backend
- 💰 **Lower memory usage** - Runs efficiently on any machine

- **Technical Writers** - Add clear diagrams to docs and tutorials
- **Project Managers** - Visualize processes and delivery plans
- **Students** - Create diagrams for assignments and presentations

## 🎨 Example Mermaid Diagrams

Try these examples in Mermalaid:

### Flowchart Example

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
    B -->|No| D[Action 2]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```

### Sequence Diagram Example

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>Alice: Great!
```

### Class Diagram Example

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +String name
        +int age
        +eat()
    }
    class Dog {
        +bark()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
```

## 🔧 Development & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust (Tauri will install automatically if not present)
- macOS (to build the macOS app) or Windows 10/11 with the Microsoft C++ Build Tools (to build the Windows installer)

### Running in Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Tauri in development mode (desktop app)
npm run tauri:dev

# Or run web version only
npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173`
2. Launch Tauri with the development server (if using desktop)
3. Hot reload your React app

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build web assets
npm run build

# Build the desktop app for the current platform
npm run tauri:build
```

The built app will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:
- macOS: `.app` bundle and `.dmg` installer
- Windows: x64 NSIS `.exe` installer

### Installing the Desktop App

**Important:** The app is currently unsigned (not code-signed), so macOS warns you the first time you open the app and Windows warns you when you run the installer.

#### macOS

macOS may report the app as "damaged" when you first open it.

**Recommended Installation Method:**
```bash
# 1. Copy the app from the DMG to Applications
cp -R /Volumes/Mermalaid_*/Mermalaid.app /Applications/

# 2. Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -cr /Applications/Mermalaid.app

# 3. Open the app
open /Applications/Mermalaid.app
```

**Alternative: System Settings**
1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to see the blocked app message
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the Mermalaid warning
4. Click **"Open"** in the confirmation dialog

#### Windows

The installer is unsigned, so SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC" when you run the `.exe`. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway** to continue with the installation.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `⌘N` (Mac) / `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux): New diagram (opens a new tab)
- `⌘O` / `Ctrl+O`: Open file (in its own tab)
- `⌘S` / `Ctrl+S`: Save file
- `⌘T` / `Ctrl+T`: New tab
- `⌘W` / `Ctrl+W`: Close tab (`⇧⌘W` closes the window)
- `⌃Tab` / `⌃⇧Tab`: Next / previous tab
- `⌘1`…`⌘9`: Jump to tab (`⌘9` is the last tab)

Browsers reserve some of these for their own tabs, so `⌘T`, `⌘W`, `⌃Tab` and `⌘1`…`⌘9` are
desktop-app shortcuts; on the web use the tab bar, or `⌘⌥←` / `⌘⌥→` to step between tabs.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Tauri won't start:**
- Make sure Rust is installed: `rustc --version`
- Tauri will prompt to install Rust if missing
- Check that port 5173 is available for dev server

**Build fails:**
- Ensure you've run `npm run build` first
- Check that `dist/` directory exists with built files
- On macOS, you may need to allow the app in Security & Privacy settings

**App size concerns:**
- Tauri apps are much smaller than Electron (~10MB vs ~100MB+)
- First build may take longer as Rust compiles dependencies
